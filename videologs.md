To document and share our work we have been doing regular [video logs][1] on youtube where we talk about different things including the projects we have been working on and new technology that we are exploring. Anything related to physical computing and open source technologies, be it software, hardware or making.

We also have semi-regular weekly team lunch meetings to share internal knowledge. We have documented a few of them and share them on [youtube playlist][2] to our followers. We call them the WSBL sessions, short for White Squared Box Lunch, since we usually order pizza.
