We reached the end of the development time for this R&D project. All the deadlines and objectives were reached successfully. Howhever, due to changes in the team we feel we could use a few more months to solidify some of the activities, namely the exposure of the project and the pilots. For these reasons we applied to an extension of the project, and we recently got news that the extension has been approved for more 6 months (until February 2017).
