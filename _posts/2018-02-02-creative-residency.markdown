We did a creative residency with the entire team and a couple of guests (the creator of Bonsai, Gonçalo Lopes and Frazão) at Montemor o Velho. We took the opportunity to tie some loose ends on this R&D project, experiment a few things in VR, AR, computer vision and making of a DIY instrument. Everything is documented at our youtube channel [1][1] [2][2] [3][3].
