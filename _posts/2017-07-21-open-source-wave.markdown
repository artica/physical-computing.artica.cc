On the last few weeks we been taking some time to clean up and announce publically the open source of few more of our projects / products. Namely the repos related to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/account/user/artica/projects/GYRO">Gyro</a> and our <a href="https://bitbucket.org/account/user/artica/projects/BA">Bonsai.Artica</a> package for Bonsai.
