On July 24th of 2015 we had our first planning meeting to prepare a project plan for the P2020 submission of an individual research and development 2 year plan for innovating and testing our technology aiming to improve the competitiveness in the creative industries market.

We sat down and listed the different technologies we wanted to explore for the next 2 years in a relistic time frame that would give us time to revise the state of the art, try new things and prototype them in real use case pilots in the field.

We discussed what we were already doing, where we wanted to go with it, what was emerging worth exploring and what areas we should be focusing more on.
